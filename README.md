# Face Recognition System using OpenCV & Deep Learning

This project is a face recognition system that detects faces using OpenCV’s Haar cascades and extracts embeddings using a deep learning model. It allows users to upload images, preprocess them, generate embeddings, and recognize individuals from a dataset.

## Features
✅ Face detection using Haar cascade classifiers  
✅ Face embedding extraction with a deep learning model  
✅ Standardized embeddings using StandardScaler  
✅ Streamlit-based user interface for uploading images  
✅ Uses ngrok for hosting in Colab  
✅ Supports multiple celebrities from a custom dataset

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Ngrok

## How It Works

1️⃣ Upload an Image – The system detects faces using Haar cascades  
2️⃣ Preprocessing – The detected face is resized and normalized  
3️⃣ Embedding Generation – The deep learning model extracts facial embeddings  
4️⃣ Face Recognition – The system compares embeddings with stored ones

## Dataset & Trained Celebrities  
The model is trained on a dataset containing images of the following celebrities:  

- Akshay Kumar  
- Deepika Padukone  
- Nora Fatehi  
- Ranbir Kapoor  
- Urvashi Rautela  
- Virat Kohli  
- Maria Sharapova  
- Lionel Messi
